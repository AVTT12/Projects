# SQL-Queries
##
The project focuses on using SQL queries to analyze potential security threats arising from login attempts and employee machines within the organization. Various scenarios are addressed:

Retrieve after-hours failed login attempts: Queries are executed to investigate failed login attempts after business hours, specifically after 18:00.

Retrieve login attempts on specific dates: Queries are used to examine login activities on particular dates, aiding in the investigation of irregular occurrences.

Retrieve login attempts outside of Mexico: The SQL queries aim to identify login attempts made outside of Mexico, helping identify potential security risks.

Retrieve employees in Marketing: Queries are employed to identify employees in the Marketing department, particularly those in the East building, facilitating the updating of their computers.

Retrieve employees in Finance or Sales: SQL queries are utilized to filter employees in the Sales and Finance departments for a separate security upgrade.

Retrieve all employees not in IT: Queries are executed to gather information on employees outside the Information Technology department, necessary for adjusting security settings.

The SQL queries leverage various clauses such as WHERE, AND, OR, and NOT, along with LIKE and wildcard symbols, to filter and retrieve precise data from tables such as employees and log_in_attempts. These queries aid in identifying trends and potential security threats within the organization's systems.
